# Indian Job Fraud Detector

A machine learning system that detects fraudulent job postings in the Indian market - deployed as a live API, Chrome extension, and public web interface.

**Live demo:** https://aditsawhney.github.io/Fraud-Job-Detector

---

## Overview

Job fraud is a significant problem in India. Scams involving upfront registration fees, Aadhaar/PAN collection, WhatsApp-only contacts, and MNC impersonation are widespread. No publicly labeled dataset of Indian job fraud existed, so this project builds one from scratch and trains a model on it.

The system combines TF-IDF text analysis with 15 hand-engineered India-specific fraud signals, wrapped in a FastAPI backend and surfaced through a Chrome extension that runs inline on LinkedIn job pages.

## Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Test accuracy | 0.94 |
| Fraud F1 | 0.94 |
| Real F1 | 0.93 |
| False positives | 8 |
| False negatives | 12 |

Evaluated on a held-out test set of 318 rows.

**Caveat:** the real class is majority synthetic. These metrics likely overstate real-world performance - no evaluation on genuine LinkedIn postings has been done yet.

## Dataset

Three-source hybrid — 2,118 rows total.

| Source | Rows | Label |
|--------|------|-------|
| Groq-generated synthetic Indian jobs | 452 | real |
| Groq-generated synthetic Indian jobs | 300 | fraud |
| EMSCAD benchmark dataset | 500 | real |
| EMSCAD benchmark dataset | 866 | fraud |

The 300 synthetic fraud rows cover 6 Indian-specific archetypes (50 each): fee-based scams, data harvesting, guaranteed placement, simple task scams, MNC impersonation, and overseas visa fraud. Generated using `data_pipeline/generate_dataset.py`, grounded in a documented taxonomy in `data_pipeline/indian_fraud_taxonomy.py`.

EMSCAD adds real human-written Western scam postings to diversify the fraud class beyond purely synthetic data.

## Model

**Architecture:** `CombinedFeatureExtractor` — a single sklearn transformer that computes:
- TF-IDF (1–2 ngrams, 30k features, sublinear_tf)
- 15 hand-crafted Indian fraud regex features
- 2 meta-features: `total_flags`, `flag_density`

These are hstacked into one sparse matrix and fed into a `LogisticRegression` classifier (`class_weight='balanced'`, C=1.0).

Logistic regression was chosen deliberately: `coef_` gives direct feature-level explainability, inference is fast enough for Render's free tier, and the dataset (2,118 rows) is too small to justify deep models.

### 15 Indian fraud signals

`fee_language` · `upfront_payment` · `unrealistic_salary` · `guaranteed_job` · `whatsapp_only` · `gmail_contact` · `personal_phone` · `aadhaar_request` · `pan_request` · `bank_details_early` · `mnc_impersonation` · `background_check_fee` · `overseas_visa_fee` · `simple_task_scam` · `vague_company`

## Running locally

**Backend**

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

The backend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. `model/features.py` must be present alongside `app.py` for the pickle to deserialise correctly.

**Website**

```bash
cd website
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`.

**Extension**

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Click "Load unpacked" → select the `extension/` folder
4. Navigate to a LinkedIn job posting on `linkedin.com/jobs/view/`

## Known limitations

- Metrics are measured on a partially synthetic dataset and likely overstate real-world performance.
- Short legitimate company names (EY, TCS) occasionally trip the `vague_company` feature.
- LinkedIn's search results layout (`/jobs/search-results/`) uses obfuscated class names and is not supported. The extension prompts users to open the full job view instead.
- Render free tier spins down after inactivity - first request after idle takes ~30 seconds. The extension and website fall back to local heuristics during this time.
